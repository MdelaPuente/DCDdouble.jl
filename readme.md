# DCDdouble.jl

A Julia package for reading .dcd trajectory files.

This package is heavily inspired by the one developed by Michael von Domaros (`mvondomaros`) which can be found
in their [repository](https://github.com/mvondomaros/DCD.jl).

It has been adapted to read the trajectories generated by the LAMMPS software (instead of NAMD) and
is in Float64 precision by default (instead of Float32). 

## Installation

```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/MdelaPuente/DCDdouble.jl
```

## Usage

```julia
using DCDdouble

dcd = load_dcd("foo.dcd")

na = natoms(dcd)  # Get the number of atoms.
nf = nframes(dcd) # Get the number of frames.
δt = timestep(dcd)  # Get the time step.
hascell(dcd)  # Check if the DCD file has unit cell information.

for frame in dcd  # Iterate over each frame.
  r = positions(frame)  # Get an array of Float64 of all current positions with dimensions (3, na).
  c = cell(dcd)  # Get the unit cell vector [$a, b, c, α, β, γ].
  t = elapsedtime(frame)  # Get the simulation time (in fs) of the current frame.
  
  # Do stuff.
end
```

Happy coding and big thanks to `mvondomaros` for their work!
